## The Term Hacker

<p>"Unfortunately, this term has been twisted to have negative connotations, which it did not used to have."


While the techniques used by hackers may become obsolete, I believe the mindset does not.
Hackers look for weaknesses and, depending on their preferences, either exploit or try to fix them.
And I believe that the good that hackers do is more important now than ever.


"A good hacker can't just rely on tools."
It's a combination of abilities, mindset, and motivation...the tools come second."


"A fool with a tool is still a fool," as any pentester would say.
It's all about attitude and perseverance." </p>
